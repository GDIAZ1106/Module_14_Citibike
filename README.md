# Overview of the analysis: 

The analysis has the intention to use Citi Bike data that has been released as a proxy of how a bike system could work in Des Moines City. 

The intention is also to extract information that could be useful to implement a better service that could be more successful by considering the current client behavior. 

# Important information related to the information 

It is important to remark that in several visualizations it have been decided not to use the information related to Gender N/A since the quality of the information was not reliable. We believe that this information was generated by customers users that do not fill the required information to ride the bikes and is a system default that distortion the information. The majority of the 

# Results

The most important findings have been included in the Tableau Story performed to compile that information.

We have proven that predominant use of male gender in the use of the bike, being the younger population from the range 24 to 37 that concentrate the major part of the rides.

The younger people use longer the bikes. Female gender use less frequent the bikes but for a longer period. As far as most of the use is concentrated during the hours to enter / exit from work (excluding Saturday and Sundays) probably the longer use is related to the clothes that women use that makes them go slower. This also could justify the fact that bikes are used 72% by males.

Important to notice that in Saturday an Sunday the use of the bike changes dramatically and is more linked to the period of daylight.

It is expected that the Customer sector is linked to tourist, mainly because the way they ride is pretty similar to the subscribers  during weekends. This is the average use per trip per Li

# Summary: 

We have good volume of data to conclude about the following topics:

- The system is a popular method to shorten distances when arriving at work or going home during working days. To increase the penetration of the service on the female gender, could be a good idea to provide an electrical engine to the bikes, that would reduce the effort and would make more useful to reach work on a good way. What is being suggested is an hybrid method of transportation. Another useful thing would be to provide a bigger basket to hold personal belongings better.

- Tourism complement quite well the use of bikes when they are not so requested by subscribers. A recommendation could be to create cheaper packages for accessing the bike to be offered on the hotels to incentivize the use of bikes in the city. 

- The use of bikes constitutes a green solution for mobility inside any city. This initiative could receive some sort of support from the local government. 

## Things to be analyzed

A closer look up to the target city "Des Moines" is needed the analysis should be focused in the following topics:

        - Does the city have important congestion during rush-hours that could generate an interest of the population to use the bikes during those hours?

        - Have the city any sort of tourist attraction that generate a secondary segment of costumers?

        - An analysis of the city is possible and needed in advance of doing any investment.

        - It is also necessary to analyze the profitability of the business since this report have only analyzed patterns of the target customers.
